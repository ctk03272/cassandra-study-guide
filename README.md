## 🤖 Built with Antigravity
This entire project—from the conceptual structure and simulation logic to the frontend implementation—was collaboratively built using **Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding agent powered by Google DeepMind.

It demonstrates how AI-assisted engineering can accelerate updating complex technical educational materials with:
- **Zero-Latency Interactions**
- **In-Browser Simulations** (Compaction, High Availability, Ring Consistent Hashing)
- **Deep Technical Accuracy** (Internal Architecture, Tuning Parameters)

---

## 📚 Key Modules
1.  **Architecture & Data Model**: Ring Topology, Consistent Hashing, LSM Tree.
2.  **Internal Mechanics**: Write Path (Memtable/SSTable), Read Path (Bloom Filters/Caches).
3.  **Consistency & Availability**: CAP Theorem, Tunable Consistency (CL=QUORUM).
4.  **Production Operations**: Compaction Strategies (STCS, LCS, TWCS), Multi-DC Replication.
5.  **Performance Tuning**: JVM (ZGC), OS Kernel, Speculative Retry.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Pure Vanilla JS & HTML5** (No Frameworks)
- **TailwindCSS** (Styling)
- **Chart.js** (Performance Metrics)
- **Mermaid.js** (Architecture Diagrams)
